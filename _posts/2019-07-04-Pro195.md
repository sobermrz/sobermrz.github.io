# 问题描述
Given a text file file.txt, print just the 10th line of the file.

Example:

Assume that file.txt has the following content:

Line 1

Line 2

Line 3

Line 4

Line 5

Line 6

Line 7

Line 8

Line 9

Line 10

Your script should output the tenth line, which is:

Line 10

Note:

1. If the file contains less than 10 lines, what should you output?

2. There's at least three different solutions. Try to explore all possibilities.
